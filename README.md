# Demo Connect4 App
In this demo app I created a classic Connect4 Game application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Classic Connect4 game
2. Score Labels

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UICollectionView, UICollectionViewCells
2. UIKit and Storyboard

## Might add in the future
1. Set the game score
2. Set the player names
3. UserDefaults for unfinished game and names
